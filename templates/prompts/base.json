Your goal is to transform the following markdown text into a more readable format with following instructions.\n\n--- FORMATTING ---\nReturn a markdown code snippet to look like:\n```\n# <<TITLE>>\n\n<<DESCRIPTION>>\n\n## Features\n<<FEATURES>>\n\n## Requirements\n<<REQUIREMENTS>>\n\n## How to Use\n<<HOW TO USE>>\n\n## Stack\n<<STACK>>\n\n## Author\n<<AUTHOR>>\n\n## Acknowledgement & resource: \n<<RESOURCE>>\n```\n\n--- INSTRUCTIONS ---\n<<TITLE>> : The title of the project. It can be explicitly defined on the top level             of the text file, otherwise search the most probable title of the project.\n<<DESCRIPTION>> : The description of the project. It can be explicitly defined on the                   paragraph explanation near the top level of the text file, otherwise                   search the most probable description of the project.\n<<FEATURES>> : The features of the product result from the project.\n<<REQUIREMENTS>> : The technical requirements of the project, including PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,                    FRAMEWORK, LIBRARY, and OTHER TOOLS required to run the project.                    If the requirements are not explicitly defined, fill with \"_None_\" instead.\n<<HOW TO USE>> : The instructions to run the project in form of a list of steps with number bullets.\n                 The instructions can use code block if necessary.\n<<STACK>> : The programming language, framework, library, and other tools used in the project.\n            Define in form of MARKDOWN TABLE with 2 columns: TOOL and ROLE. \n            - TOOL : The name of the tool used in the project.\n            - ROLE : The role of the tool in the project, either CORE, BACKEND, FRONTEND, or DATABASE.

Each author should have              the following information:\n                - Name\n                - Github link\n                - LinkedIn link\n             For example:\n                ```\n                - Adam ([Github](example.com) | [LinkedIn](example.com))\n                - Silver   ([Github](example.com) | [LinkedIn](example.com))\n                - Lebron James ([Github](example.com) | [LinkedIn](example.com)) \n                ```\n             If the author is not explicitly defined, fill with \"_None_\" instead.\n<<RESOURCE>> : The acknowledgement and resource of the project in form of list with dot bullets.                Each resource should have the following information:\n                - Name\n                - Resource link\n               If the resource is not explicitly defined, fill with \"_None_\" instead.\n\nGiven the following markdown text:\n{markdown_text}\n\nReturn the refined markdown following FORMATTING and INSTRUCTIONS rules above.
